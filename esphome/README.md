# HAIR ESPHome Configurations

Curated, HAIR-tested ESPHome configurations for common IR hardware. Each config carries a machine-readable header with device info, GPIO map, tested versions, and contributor attribution. Pick your device, copy the config, flash via the ESPHome Dashboard, and you are ready to use HAIR's Sniffer and Devices tabs.

## How to pick a config

**I have a dev board and want to wire up IR LEDs:** Pick one of the generic configs. The ESP32-C3 and ESP32 doit configs are both DIY paths -- you supply the IR LED (with transistor driver) and IR receiver module.

**I want commercial off-the-shelf with no soldering:** The [Athom RF IR Remote](https://www.athom.tech/) and [XIAO Smart IR Mate](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-Smart-IR-Mate.html) are the easiest paths. Both have IR LED, receiver, and status LED built in. The Athom also has 433 MHz RF hardware. Start with the minimal variant.

## Two-tier convention

Each device folder can have up to two config variants:

**Minimal** (`-minimal.yaml`): The smallest ESPHome config that gets IR TX + RX working with HAIR. Strips everything else. Start here.

**Full** (`-full.yaml`): Preserves the device's full hardware capabilities (touch pads, RGB LEDs, vibration motors, etc.). Heavier YAML but the device behaves fully. Available when a contributor has provided one.

Users pick based on appetite. The minimal version is always tested first and is the recommended starting point.

## Contributing a config

We welcome ESPHome IR configs for hardware we do not have yet. To contribute:

1. Copy the header template from [`_template/header-template.yaml`](_template/header-template.yaml) to the top of your config and fill in every field
2. Test the config against the HAIR and HA versions listed in your header (capture a signal with the Sniffer, send a command through the Devices tab)
3. Open a PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/DAB-LABS/HAIR) or post in the [HA Community forum thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/1010610) and link us
4. We will not merge configs without the header block fully filled out

Configs are licensed Apache 2.0. Attribution is always preserved -- your handle and source link stay in the header permanently.
