"""Trigger manager for HAIR.

Tracks per-trigger hit counts and fires HA event entities when the
configured ``min_hits`` threshold is reached within the reset window.

v0.5.7 (location-aware triggers): each capture is threaded with the
receiver that observed it. Triggers gain an optional receiver scope
(``matches_receiver``); the fire payload carries the receiver entity plus
its resolved area. A single physical press captured by several receivers
within ``MULTI_RECEIVER_DEDUP_WINDOW_S`` counts once per (trigger,
fingerprint) so multi-receiver setups do not double-count toward
``min_hits`` or double-fire.

        Repoint rule: a trigger on the old fingerprint is rewired when its
        byte-level and decoded identities are each either unknown on one
        side or equal -- precise for scoped triggers, broad for legacy

        knowledge of the new identity, so this is a strict improvement.
