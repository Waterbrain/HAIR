"""NEC protocol decoding via Home Assistant's bundled infrared-protocols.

Phase A of the protocols integration (v0.4.0): HAIR decodes captured
signals as NEC when the library can read them and stores the decoded
identity alongside the raw Pronto, so later releases can match by decoded
fingerprint and transmit canonical timings instead of replaying captured
(receiver-distorted) timings.

The library is consumed via HA core's ``infrared`` dependency -- there is
no ``manifest.json`` pin. All access is guarded so a missing or
restructured library degrades cleanly to "no decode" rather than breaking
the capture path. Adding a protocol is a one-line addition to
``try_decode`` once the library ships that protocol's ``from_raw_timings``
classmethod.
