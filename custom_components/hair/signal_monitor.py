"""Always-on IR signal monitor for HAIR.

Supports two receive paths:

1. **Native (HA 2026.6+):** subscribes to each ``InfraredReceiverEntity``
   via ``infrared.async_subscribe_receiver()``.  Hardware-agnostic --
   any integration implementing the receiver entity works automatically.
2. **Legacy (HA 2026.4-2026.5):** falls back to listening for
   ``esphome.remote_received`` events on the HA event bus.  Requires
   the ESPHome YAML bridge (``on_pronto`` + ``homeassistant.event``).

Groups observed signals by source device and surfaces unknown IR
activity for user assignment.

        - *Does this HA ship the native receiver API?* A capability
          question, stable for the process lifetime, answered by whether
          the import succeeds. This -- and ONLY this -- selects legacy
          mode (HA 2026.4-2026.5, ``_start_legacy_event_bus``).
        - *Are any receivers present right now?* A transient inventory
          question whose answer can legitimately be "none yet" (cold-boot
          ordering, proxy added later). Inventory is handled by
          ``_reconcile_receivers`` and the domain trackers, never by
          falling back to the legacy bus -- the old empty-inventory
          fallback latched HAIR onto a channel our shipped YAML does not
          even emit, permanently, until a manual reload.

        Even when the native path is active, we also wire a tracking-only
        listener on ``esphome.remote_received`` so the Receivers UI can
        surface ``RX-BRIDGE`` for devices that still have ``on_pronto:``
        YAML configured alongside their native receiver (this now also
        covers the native-with-zero-receivers wait state). In legacy mode
        the main ``_on_ir_event`` handler already records device_ids as
