"""Tiered signal identity -- the one shared answer to "same signal?".

Unified signal identity (v0.5.8, second half). Three identity layers
exist for every captured signal, from most to least precise:

1. ``decoded_fingerprint`` -- the protocol library decoded the signal
   (NEC today on live captures; more protocols as upstream decoders
   land). Immune to timing jitter. The permanent answer.
2. ``byte_hash`` -- quantized timing words (20-unit bins), present on
   essentially every Pronto capture. Robust to the jitter that breaks
   the S/L fingerprint (Sony's long mark sits exactly ON the 48-unit
   S/L threshold, so the same button flips fingerprints between
   captures; its byte_hash survives the round trip exactly).
3. ``signal_fingerprint`` (S/L) -- the coarse short/long pattern.
   Retained for records that carry nothing better (non-Pronto legacy
   protocol/code pairs, pre-byte_hash data).

Match rule: two signals are the same when the highest tier they BOTH
carry agrees. A tier that only one side carries is skipped (never
fatal); a tier both sides carry decides (a mismatch there does NOT
fall through to a lower tier). This is a strict generalization of the
byte_hash trigger-identity rule: the only new truth-table cell is
"fingerprint mismatch + byte_hash match", which used to be a miss and
is now a match. No previously-working match can regress.

Every identity consumer (trigger matching, the known-command matcher,
Sniffer dedup, repeat suppression, the Assign-dot index) goes through
this module so the rule cannot drift between call sites.
