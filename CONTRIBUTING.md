## Pull Requests

- Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/my-change`)
- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include tests for new backend functionality
- Make sure `pytest` and `ruff check .` pass before opening a PR
- Write a clear PR description explaining what changed and why

## Bug Reports

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/DAB-LABS/HAIR/issues). Include:

- Your HA version
- HAIR version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant log output (Settings > System > Logs, filter for `hair`)

## Code Style

- Python: follow existing patterns, ruff handles formatting
- TypeScript: LitElement conventions, Lit decorators for properties
- Keep public-facing text (README, comments, UI copy) free of em-dashes
